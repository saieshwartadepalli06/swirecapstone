## Business Problem 
In Spring 2024, our team, 'Swire Innovators,' at the University of Utah's Master of Science in Business Analytics program undertook a Capstone project in collaboration with Swire Coca-Cola. Our objective was to master the art of forecasting demand for their seven innovative beverage products, aiming to **optimize production** and **inventory management** across 13 states in the American West.

## Project Overview
The project involved detailed exploratory data analysis and predictive time-series modeling to forecast the demand for newly launching products. We compared these products with historical data of similar products, ensuring that Swire Coca-Cola could manage their resources efficiently without facing overproduction or shortages, thereby maintaining customer satisfaction and minimizing costs.

## Solution 
We tackled the demand forecasting for a range of products including Diet Smash Plum, Sparkling Jacceptabletlester Avocado, and Diet Venomous Blast Energy. Our approach utilized historical sales data, and we applied advanced analytical techniques:<br>

**ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**: For understanding and predicting future points in the series.<br>
**Exponential Smoothing**: To forecast data with complex seasonal patterns.<br>
**Facebook Prophet**: For its robust handling of daily seasonality with quick and accurate results.

## Technologies Used
**Python**: For data processing and machine learning models.<br>
**Google BigQuery**: For managing large datasets.<br>
**Google Looker and Tableau**: For data visualization.<br>
**Docker, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and Flask**: For developing the interactive web platform that allows stakeholders to visualize forecasting results in real-time with a survey feature included.

## Contribution 
I led the data analysis using Google BigQuery, performed complex SQL queries, optimized visualizations using Google Looker and Tableau, and managed the deployment of our web platform using Docker and Flask. I also provided extensive documentation and detailed code reviews to ensure clarity.

## Business Value 
The project delivered substantial business value by:

**Reducing Costs**: Efficient inventory management helped in cutting down unnecessary production costs based on weekly sales forecasts.<br>
**Supporting Strategic Decisions**: The insights from our forecasts are being used to make informed decisions about product launches and adjustments.<br>
**Customer Sentiment**: Data collected from customers via our dashboard helped Swire measure which products were most liked, aiding in strategic product planning.

## Challenges
I encountered several challenges, including:

**Data Integration**: Combining data from large data files into a cohesive dataset was initially challenging. I used BigQuery to streamline this process.<br>
**Model Tuning**: Adjusting parameters to improve the accuracy of our forecasts required iterative testing and validation. I invested in Google Colab Pro to extensively work on model tuning.<br>
**Meeting Swire's Expectations**: Balancing technical possibilities with Swire expectations was a continuous learning process for us. We strived to perform all tasks within the given timeframe and delivered accurate results.

## Learnings
**Technical Skills**: I advanced my expertise in machine learning algorithms and big data platforms. I researched many time-series models and had the opportunity to implement them.<br>
**Team Collaboration**: Enhanced our ability to work effectively as a team under pressure, aligning our efforts towards a common goal. We had limited meeting times which emphasized the importance of individual work.<br>
**Business Skills**: The recommendations derived from the insights we analyzed taught us what companies expect from our work. Learning to focus only on pivotal tasks was crucial for maintaining strategic direction. I also developed judgment skills which are vital in business strategy.<br>

This Capstone project was not only a demonstration of our technical abilities but also an opportunity to make a tangible impact on a leading company's operational strategy. The skills and insights gained from this experience are invaluable as we continue our careers in data science, analytics and data engineering.
