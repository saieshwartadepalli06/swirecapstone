## Project Overview
In the Spring of 2024, our team at the University of Utah's Master of Science in Business Analytics program undertook a Capstone project in collaboration with Swire Coca-Cola. Our objective was to master the art of forecasting demand for innovative beverage products, aiming to optimize production and inventory management across 13 states in the American West.

The Challenge
Swire Coca-Cola needed to forecast demand for newly introduced beverages accurately to avoid overproduction and stock-outs, thereby enhancing customer satisfaction and reducing costs.

The Approach
Our project focused on forecasting for products like Diet Smash Plum, Sparkling Jacceptabletlester Avocado, and Diet Venomous Blast Energy. We used historical sales data and implemented advanced analytical techniques such as ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and Facebook Prophet.

## Technologies Used
Python: For data processing and machine learning models.
Google BigQuery: For managing large datasets.
Google Looker and Tableau: For data visualization.
Docker, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and Flask: For developing the interactive web platform.
